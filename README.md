# API_Financial_Planing

# Background
On this challenge, i had the opportunity to explore owning my own Fintech consulting firm, which main focus is to have an impact on my community. A local credit union reached out for help to create a tool that helps their members enhance their financial health and reach financial goals. 

The credit union wants to allow the union's members to assess their monthly personal finances, and also be able to forecast a reasonably good retirement plan based on cryptocurrencies, stocks, and bonds.In order to create this tool, i will be using APIs as part of the technical solution to create two financial analysis tools.

The first will be a personal finance planner that will allow users to visualize their savings composed by investments in shares and cryptocurrencies to assess if they have enough money as an emergency fund (very important specially during COVID).

The second tool will be a retirement planning tool that will use the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio composed of stocks and bonds, then run Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years. The Monte Carlo data will calculate the expected portfolio returns given a specific initial investment amount.
